# Core Concepts of UCL 5.0: The UCL Message Envelope

Every UCL 5.0 "GraphNative" message begins with an **Envelope**. The envelope provides essential routing information, defines the primary operation, and associates high-level modifiers like a Context Mixer Profile. It sets the stage before the detailed `PayloadGraph` is presented.

The structure of the UCL 5.0 envelope is designed for clarity and to directly support its graph-native payload and advanced context management.

## Standard Envelope Structure

The canonical textual structure of a UCL 5.0 message envelope is:

```text
[Source_UCLID] > Target_UCLID execute Operation_UCLID [^ModifierPredicate1 ModifierValue1] [^ModifierPredicate2 ModifierValue2] ... :
```

Let's break down each component:

1.  **`Source_UCLID` (Optional)**
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies the originator or sender of the UCL message.
    *   **Format:** A UCL-ID (URI or CURIE).
    *   **Optionality:** If omitted, the source might be implicit from the communication channel or not relevant for the interaction.
    *   **Example:** `ucl:id:UserAgent789` or `myapp:service:OrderProcessor`

2.  **`>` (Direction Operator)**
    *   **Purpose:** Indicates the primary direction of the message flow, from the `Source_UCLID` (if present) to the `Target_UCLID`.
    *   **Format:** The greater-than symbol (`>`).
    *   **Optionality & Default:** While often present for clarity, if the `Source_UCLID` is omitted, the `>` is also typically omitted. The default direction is generally assumed to be towards the `Target_UCLID` for a request. UCL 5.0 simplifies this from UCL 4.2's multiple direction tokens, as complex interaction patterns (like responses or broadcasts) can be modeled via the `Operation_UCLID` semantics or specific Context Mixer profiles.

3.  **`Target_UCLID` (Mandatory)**
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies the primary recipient, process, or entity the message is addressed to or primarily concerns.
    *   **Format:** A UCL-ID.
    *   **Example:** `llm:agent:AdvancedTextGenerator` or `ucl:service:KnowledgeGraphInterface`

4.  **`execute` (Primary Operation Verb)**
    *   **Purpose:** The primary verb indicating that the `Target_UCLID` is to perform or process the specified `Operation_UCLID`.
    *   **Format:** The literal keyword `execute`.
    *   **Rationale:** UCL 5.0 standardizes on `execute` as the main high-level verb in the envelope to simplify parsing and interaction with LLMs. The specific nature of the action is then detailed in the `Operation_UCLID` and the `PayloadGraph`. Other general verbs (like `query`, `create` from UCL 4.2) are now typically encapsulated within the semantics of the `Operation_UCLID` itself (e.g., `execute myapp:action:QueryBooksByAuthor`).

5.  **`Operation_UCLID` (Mandatory)**
    *   **Purpose:** A UCL-ID that precisely defines the specific action, task, or process to be performed. This is where the detailed semantic intent of the operation resides.
    *   **Format:** A UCL-ID.
    *   **Example:** `myapp:action:GenerateMarketReport`, `schema:FindAction`, `ucl_task:TranslateDocument`

6.  **`^ModifierPredicate ModifierValue` (Optional Modifiers)**
    *   **Purpose:** To attach high-level qualifying information or parameters directly to the main operation defined in the envelope. These modifiers influence the overall execution of the operation.
    *   **Format:** Starts with a caret (`^`) followed by a `ModifierPredicate` (a UCL-ID) and then a `ModifierValue` (which can be a UCL-ID or a Literal). Multiple modifiers can be present, each prefixed with `^`.
    *   **Key Use Case:** Associating a Context Mixer Profile: `^cm:profile cm:profile:MySpecificAnalysisProfile`
    *   **Other Examples:**
        *   `^ucl_meta:priority ucl_meta:value:High`
        *   `^llm:languageForResponse "fr-CA"`
        *   `^ucl_meta:deadline "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"`
    *   **Distinction from Payload:** Modifiers in the envelope are for orchestrating the *how* of the overall operation, while detailed data parameters for the operation itself go into the `PayloadGraph`.

7.  **`:` (Payload Separator)**
    *   **Purpose:** A mandatory separator indicating the end of the envelope (and its modifiers) and the beginning of the `PayloadGraph`.
    *   **Format:** A colon (`:`).

## Example Envelopes

**Simple Execution:**
```ucl
llm:agent:MyLLM execute myapp:action:SummarizeText :
```
(PayloadGraph would follow)

**With Source and Context Mixer Profile:**
```ucl
ucl:id:ReportingSystem > ucl:service:AnalyticsEngine execute fin_ont:action:GenerateQuarterlyReport ^cm:profile cm:profile:FinanceReportStrict ^ucl_meta:outputFormat "PDF" :
```
(PayloadGraph would follow)

**Minimal (Target and Operation only):**
```ucl
ucl:service:DeviceManager execute iot:action:GetDeviceStatus :
```
(PayloadGraph would follow)

## Comparison with UCL 4.2 Envelope

UCL 5.0 simplifies and restructures the envelope compared to UCL 4.2:

*   **OperationVerb and OperationID_UCLID merged:** UCL 4.2 had `OperationVerb UCLID_OperationSpecific`. UCL 5.0 primarily uses `execute Operation_UCLID`, making `Operation_UCLID` carry more semantic weight for the specific action.
*   **ModifiersPart integrated:** UCL 4.2 had a distinct `ModifiersPart` (`^mod1 ^mod2`). UCL 5.0 integrates modifiers directly onto the operation line using the `^Predicate Value` syntax, making them more explicitly key-value pairs.
*   **Direction simplified:** `>` is the primary explicit direction, focusing on request-response, with other patterns modeled differently.

The UCL 5.0 envelope is designed to be a clear, concise header that sets up the more detailed and expressive `PayloadGraph` and the sophisticated `ContextMixer` operations.
