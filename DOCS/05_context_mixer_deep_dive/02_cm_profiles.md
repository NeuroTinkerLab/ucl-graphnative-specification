# Context Mixer Deep Dive: Defining and Using Profiles (`cm:Profile`)

The heart of UCL 5.0's advanced context management lies in the **Context Mixer Profile (`cm:Profile`)**. A profile is a reusable, named configuration that dictates how various contextual influences should be interpreted, weighted, filtered, and combined to guide the processing of a UCL message by an AI or other system.

This document explains how `cm:Profile`s are conceptually defined and associated with UCL 5.0 operations.

## What is a `cm:Profile`?

A `cm:Profile` is a UCL-ID that identifies a specific set of rules for contextual processing. Its definition (which could reside in a shared knowledge base, be transmitted as part of a setup message, or even be partially defined within the `PayloadGraph` of the current message for dynamic scenarios) typically includes:

1.  **A Set of Focus Elements (`cm:FocusElement`):** These are the specific contextual aspects the profile considers (e.g., target audience, desired writing style, relevant regulations, data sources).
2.  **Weights (`cm:withWeight`):** Numerical indicators of the relative importance of each focus element.
3.  **Filters (`cm:withFilter`):** Instructions or criteria that refine how a focus element is applied.
4.  **A Mixing Strategy (`cm:appliesStrategy`):** The algorithm or logic used to combine the influences of the various focus elements.
5.  **Output Directives (`cm:guidesOutput`):** Optional instructions on how the mixed context should shape the final output or result of the operation.
6.  **Descriptive Metadata:** Name, description, version, etc., for the profile itself.

Think of a `cm:Profile` as a "recipe" for how an LLM or AI system should "think" about a task by orchestrating different contextual ingredients.

## Associating a Profile with an Operation

In a UCL 5.0 message, a `cm:Profile` is typically associated with the main operation using a modifier in the envelope:

```ucl
@prefix cm: <http://ucl-spec.org/5.0/context-mixer#> .
@prefix myapp: <http://example.com/myapp-ontology#> .

# ... other prefixes ...

# Source > Target execute Operation ^cm:profile <Profile_UCL-ID> :
ucl:id:UserX > llm:agent:AdvancedAnalyst execute myapp:action:GenerateStrategicPlan ^cm:profile cm:profile:GlobalMarketExpansionStrategy :
{
  // PayloadGraph providing data for the strategic plan
  (ucl:this) myapp:hasCompanyData <http://example.com/data/companyProfile2024> ;
             myapp:forRegion schema:Asia .
}
# ucl_project:ExpansionQ4 // Optional broader context stack
```

In this example:

`^cm:profile cm:profile:GlobalMarketExpansionStrategy` tells the `llm:agent:AdvancedAnalyst` to use the predefined `cm:profile:GlobalMarketExpansionStrategy` when executing `myapp:action:GenerateStrategicPlan`.

The LLM would then (conceptually) look up or interpret the definition of this profile to guide its analysis and plan generation.

## Defining a `cm:Profile`

The definition of a `cm:Profile` itself is expressed using UCL 5.0's graph-native principles, typically using triples. This definition might be:

*   **Pre-existing in a Knowledge Base:** The `Target_UCLID` (e.g., the LLM) might have access to a library of predefined profiles.
*   **Transmitted in a Prior Setup Message:** A system could be configured with profiles before processing operational messages.
*   **Partially or Fully Defined within the Current Message:** For highly dynamic or one-off contextual needs, parts of a profile could be defined within the `PayloadGraph` of the current message, though this is a more advanced use case.

## Conceptual Example of a `cm:Profile` Definition (using Turtle-like syntax):

```turtle
@prefix cm: <http://ucl-spec.org/5.0/context-mixer#> .
@prefix ucl_meta: <http://ucl-spec.org/5.0/metadata#> .
@prefix ucl_style: <http://ucl-spec.org/style#> .         // Hypothetical style namespace
@prefix ucl_audience: <http://ucl-spec.org/audience#> .   // Hypothetical audience namespace
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

cm:profile:CreativeBlogPostFormal a cm:Profile ;
    ucl_meta:version "1.0" ;
    schema:name "Creative Blog Post - Formal Tone" ;
    schema:description "Profile for generating creative blog posts with a formal, authoritative yet engaging style, targeted at a professional audience." ;

    // Define the focus elements and their characteristics
    cm:definesFocus
        [
            a cm:FocusElement ;
            cm:onAspect ucl_style:CreativeStorytelling ;
            cm:withWeight 0.8 ;
            cm:withFilter "Emphasize narrative arc and vivid descriptions."
        ],
        [
            a cm:FocusElement ;
            cm:onAspect ucl_style:FormalTone ;
            cm:withWeight 1.0 ; // High importance for formal tone
            cm:withFilter "Avoid slang, use precise terminology, maintain professional decorum."
        ],
        [
            a cm:FocusElement ;
            cm:onAspect ucl_audience:ProfessionalExperts ;
            cm:withWeight 0.9 ;
            cm:withFilter "Assume advanced knowledge of the topic, cite sources where appropriate."
        ],
        [
            a cm:FocusElement ;
            cm:onAspect schema:accessibility ; // General accessibility considerations
            cm:withWeight 0.5 ;
            cm:withFilter "Ensure readability, consider use of headings and lists."
        ] ;

    // Define the mixing strategy
    cm:appliesStrategy cm:strategy:WeightedPrioritization ; // Hypothetical strategy

    // Define how the context guides the output
    cm:guidesOutput "The blog post should be approximately 800-1200 words, include an introduction, 3-4 main sections, and a conclusion. Use clear headings for each section." .
```

## Key Predicates Used in Profile Definition:

*   `a cm:Profile` (or `rdf:type cm:Profile`): Declares the resource as a Context Mixer Profile.
*   `schema:name`, `schema:description`, `ucl_meta:version`: Standard metadata for the profile.
*   `cm:definesFocus`: Links the profile to one or more `cm:FocusElement` descriptions. These are often blank nodes.
*   Within each `cm:FocusElement` description:
    *   `a cm:FocusElement`: Declares it as a focus element.
    *   `cm:onAspect`: A UCL-ID pointing to the specific contextual concept (e.g., `ucl_style:FormalTone`).
    *   `cm:withWeight`: A literal (typically a float between 0 and 1) indicating importance.
    *   `cm:withFilter`: A string literal (or a UCL-ID pointing to a filter definition) with instructions.
*   `cm:appliesStrategy`: A UCL-ID pointing to a defined mixing strategy (e.g., `cm:strategy:WeightedPrioritization`).
*   `cm:guidesOutput`: A string literal (or a UCL-ID pointing to an output template/schema) describing desired output characteristics.

## Benefits of Using Profiles

*   **Reusability:** Define a profile once (e.g., for `"CustomerSupportTier1"`) and reuse it across many messages and agents.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that similar tasks are approached with the same contextual considerations, leading to more consistent AI behavior.
*   **Maintainability:** If contextual requirements change, you update the profile definition in one place, rather than modifying countless individual prompts.
*   **Abstraction:** Message senders only need to know the name (UCL-ID) of the profile, not necessarily all its intricate details, simplifying prompt construction.
*   **Specialization:** Allows for highly specialized contextual setups for different AI tasks (e.g., a profile for legal document analysis will be very different from one for creative poetry generation).

Context Mixer Profiles are the mechanism by which users and systems can explicitly "program" the contextual awareness and focus of an AI, moving beyond simple prompting to a more structured and controllable interaction.
